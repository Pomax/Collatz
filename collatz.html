<h1>The original Collatz Conjecture</h1>

    <p>The Collatz conjecture is a really simple conjecture to state:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Take any integer number $n$.
      <li>Form a new integer number $m$ by:
      <li>computing $ m = \frac{n}{2} $ if $n$ is even, or
      <li>computing $ m = 3n + 1 $ if $n$ is odd.
    </ul>

    <p>The conjecture is that this procedure will always end up at the number 1, no matter which initial $n$ was picked. We can rephrase this conjecture to an equivalent statement, by conjecting that this procedure will always lead to a number $m$ that is strictly smaller than $n$, in a finite number of steps.</p>

<h1>The generalized Collatz Conjecture</h1>

    <p>Taking the generalization, is there a pattern we can find the path lenghts to go from $n$ to $m$? Let's find out.</p>

    <pre id="generalized-1"></pre><script type="text/jsx">
      (function() {
        var pre = document.getElementById('generalized-1');
        var value = params.path || 1;
        var element = <CollatzPaths value={value} limit="100" />;
        React.render(element, pre);
      }());
    </script>

    <p>There's a few really interesting observations we can make here. For one, while the path length from $n$ to 1 might be very long indeed, the length to get to some number smaller than the starting number can be very short indeed. Ignoring the evening numbers, which by the very definition of the Collatz rules always yield a smaller number in a single step, we see that numbers of the form $4 \cdot m + 1$ seem to have path length 3 (a proof for this exists on some paper on my desk, I'll eventually add that here).

    <p>So, if $4m+1$ is also path length 3, and we can prove similar things about $16m+3$ having path length 6, and $32m+11$ always has length 8, can we say something about "which modular formulae exist given a path length $x$"? If we can, perhaps we come up with a proof where, starting with the Collatz rules, we end up necessarily generating all numbers in ℕ. So, what do we see when we look at the various path lengths?</p>

    <pre id="generalized-2"></pre><script type="text/jsx">
      (function() {
        var pre = document.getElementById('generalized-2');
        var value = params.mod || 3;
        var element = <CollatzModulos value={value} limit="30" />;
        React.render(element, pre);
      }());
    </script>

    <p>Do these modulations make sense? They look like powers of two, but that they're not really regular. Where are 64 or 512 or 2048, for instance?</p>

    <p>What about the base numbers? The first few look like they might all be primes, but the 15 and 39 show that's not true either.</p>

    <p>Another problem is that even if we can find the rules that govern which bases and modulo exist for which path length, we haven't solved the original problem: all we'll have shown is that for certain path lengths, there are Collatz numbers. Unless we can also prove that as we go up in path length, we generate ℕ, this avenue is rather interesting, but in terms of proving the Collatz conjecture, quite likely fruitless.</p>

<h1>The inverted Collatz Conjecture</h1>

    <p>We can take this rephrasing further, and conclude that the original conjecture is equivalent to stating that, starting at the number 1, and applying both Collatz rules "in reverse", we should be able to generate all integer numbers. That is:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Start at the number 1,
      <li>Form two derivative numbers by:
      <li>computing $d_1 = 2n$ and
      <li>computing $d_2 = \frac{n-1}{3}$,
      <li>ignoring any non-integener numbers that the second computation yields.
    </ul>

    <p>The conjecture is that this generates ℕ (without any claims on whether this generates ℕ sparsely or abundantly).</p>

    <h2>Generation sequences</h2>

    <p>The following (interactive) table shows us a base value and all its subsequent $2n$ values to the right of it. Taking 1 as example, we see 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, etc. and below this header line, we see potential $\frac{n-1}{3}$ values. For 1, the resulting value is 0, so we see a row of 0, 0, 0, 0, ... because consecutive multiplications of 0 by 2 keeps yielding 0. There is no derivative value for 2, as $\frac{2-1}{3}$ is not integer. For 4, the result is $\frac{4-1}{3}=1$, with its associated doublings to the right of it. For 8, the result is non-integer and so has been omitted, but for 16 the result is $\frac{16-1}{3}=5$, and so we see 5, 10, 20, 40, etc.</p>

    <pre id="invert-1"></pre><script type="text/jsx">
      (function() {
        var pre = document.getElementById('invert-1');
        var value = params.base || 1;
        var element = <CollatzMatrix value={value} limit="45" />;
        React.render(element, pre);
      }());
    </script>

    <p>This data has some interesting properties that may allow us to write compact rules for which numbers can be generated, in which way, and whether those rules imply spanning ℕ.</p>

    <p>We see that given a previously found odd number $n$ and a "new" odd number $m$, there is a relation $m = 4n+1$: 0 → 1 → 5 → 21 → 85 → 341 → 1365, etc. all progress as "four times the last number, plus one". Irrespective of the base number we pick, this is always the case.</p>

    <p>Looking at the vertical columns ending in an odd number we also see an interesting vertical progression: the number above an odd number (generated through quadrupling the previous number) is necessarily one lower than our new number: 1/0, 5/4, 21/20, 85/84, etc. However, due to how the numbers generate, there is a regularity in difference between one number and the one above: if we look at all the vertical columns, starting at the bottom, we see that for odd numbers the differences as we travel up are 1, 4, 16, 64, and so forth, with a total difference between the odd number and a number $n$ positions higher being $\sum^n_{i=0}2^{2i}$. For the even numbers, we see differences of 2, 8, 32, 128, and so forth, giving a difference between the lowest (in position, highest numerically) number and a number $n$ positions above it of $\sum^n_{i=0}2^{1+2i}$.</p>

    <p>There are numbers that "terminate" in the sense that they yield new numbers only through doubling. In the case of starting at 1, we see the numbers 21, 1365, 87381, etc. as a new possible seed, but selecting these shows us that there are no further odd-derivatives based on these numbers. Depending on the starting number, <em>if</em> there are odd derivatives, then the sequence of newly derivable odd numbers will always have <em>at least</em> one out of every three numbers (in sequence) being such a "dead end". Some numbers may yield new sequences in which two out of every three numbers are dead ends, but no number will yield a sequence in which all newly derived odd number is a dead end.</p>

    <p>We also see that certain odd numbers will lead to certain subsequent patterns: the dark blue odd numbers (0 included as odd, here), will only yield duplicative numbers. Light blue numbers yield both duplicative and new odd numbers, but will not themselves yield a new odd number, needing to be duplicated once. Light green numbers yield both duplicative and new odd numbers, themselves being the first "seed" for a new odd number. In addition to this, the way the "light green" numbers yield subsequent patterns of odd numbers is cyclical:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>The number "1" yields an odd number, but it is "terminal".
      <li>85 yields a new odd number that is itself "light green".
      <li>5461 yields a new odd number that acts "light blue".
      <li>349525 again yields a terminal
      <li>22369621 yields "light green"
      <li>1431655765 yields "light blue"
      <li>91625968981 yields terminal
    </ul>

    <p>and so forth and so forth. How subsequent expansions expand in terms of these "colours" is still uninvestigated.</p>
