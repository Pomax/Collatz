      <section id="preface">
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a> is the first challenge I was
        ever genuinely presented with. We're not talking the "I dare you to ..." or "If you don't ... you will ...", but the kind
        where someone explains a challenging problem and all you can do is sit there and go "... challenge accepted". I was a
        first year student (well, technically third, but I switched universities so first year at my new university) at the
        University of Amsterdam, embarking on a five year study of Artificial Intelligence, and the dean of faculty (yes, A.I.
        was, and hopefully still is, its own faculty. It's not just computer science with a few electives) did the standard
        welcome speech, but he did it well. He talked about complexities, the travelling salesman problem, A*, and many other
        things but what caught me was the Collatz Conjecture. It's a stupidly simple statement: pick any integer number; if it's even
        divide it by two, and if it's odd multiply it by three and add one. No matter which number you start with, as long as
        you followed those two rules you will always end up at 1. After dropping this seemingly insignificant bombshell he
        finished it up with "it's a good example of a simple problem that is almost intractibly difficult to actually prove",
        and then went on to discuss optimizing algorithms by analysing loop invariants. I should point out this was before
        the Netherlands got sucked into the European Bachelor/Masters nonsense and a five year study meant "welcome to you're
        serious about learning some shit, let's not joke around, you're paying for this".</p>

        <p>I like the Collatz conjecture. I like it a lot. Every few months I'll try to figure out something new about the
        sequence of numbers associated with it, and it's just one of those dumb recreational math things you can work on
        when you get bored with everything else. It's still there. Unsolved. So simple. Two rules. Unproven... and it doesn't
        even use any complicated mathematical notions. It's just the natural numbers, and the basic operations of arithmetic.
        What deep magic lies here....?</p>
      </section>

      <section id="introduction">
        <h2 data-num="1">Introduction</h2>

        <p>So, the Collatz Conjecture. Let's formalize it a little, because it's a really simple algorithm so let's write it
        out as one.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pick a number <b>n</b>. Literally any number <b>n</b> as long as it's an integer number (i.e. a whole number)
            and greater than 1.</li>
          <li>While <b>n</b> > 1:
            <ul>
			  <li>If <b>n</b> is even, set <b>n ← n / 2</b></li>
			  <li>If <b>n</b> is odd, set <b>n ← 3 * n + 1 </b></li>
			</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>this loop always terminates, with <b>n</b> equal to 1</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's it. The conjecture is "this algorithm is correct".</p>

        <p>So, let's resolve some chains to see where this takes us:</p>

        <ol>
  	      <li>done</li>
  	      <li>→ 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 2 → 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 4 → 2 → 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 28 → 14 → 7 → 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
        </ol>

        <p>The story checks out for the numbers 1 through 10, but that's not really going to do us much good.
          We'd need to check every number, and there are an infinite number of numbers, so that's never going
          to yield a proof. Maths is harsh that way.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="generating">
        <h2>Generating Collatz sequences</h2>

        <p>What if we look at it from the other way? Instead of taking a number and reducing it to 1, let's
        take a number and see which Collatz sequences it can generate. It might not be useful, but never look
        at a mathematical puzzle from a single perspective. The more perspectives you can come up with, the more
        possible inroads you have to understanding why it works.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pick an integer number <b>n</b></li>
          <li>generate with it the number <b>n*2</b>. This is a Collantz sequence number.</li>
          <li>generate with it the number <b>(n-1)/3</b>. If integer, this is a Collantz sequence number.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>This rephrasing is equivalent to the Collatz conjecture if we add "this procedure generates ℕ (all natural
          numbers)". Let's look at we get:</p>

        <ol>
  	      <li>→ 2 and 0</li>
  	      <li>→ 4 and 1/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 6 and 2/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 8 and 1</li>
  	      <li>→ 10 and 4/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 12 and 5/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 14 and 2</li>
  	      <li>→ 16 and 7/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 18 and 8/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 20 and 3</li>
  	      <li>→ 22 and 10/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 24 and 11/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 26 and 4</li>
  	      <li>→ 28 and 13/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 30 and 14/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 32 and 5</li>
  	      <li>→ 34 and 16/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 36 and 17/3</li>
  	      <li>→ 38 and 6</li>
  	      <li>→ 40 and 19/3</li>
  	      <li>...</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Interesting.</p>

        <p>We see that only 1 mod 3 generates an integer number (which makes sense), that 1 mod 6 generates
        an even integer, and that 4 mod 6 generates an odd integer. That's potentially important information.</p>

        <p>We also see that this expansion doesn't quite generate ℕ sparsely: some integers are repeated: 1 and 7
          both generate 2, 2 and 13 both generate 4, 3 and 19 both generate 6, and more generally <b>k</b> and
          <b>6k+1</b> both generate <b>2k</b>. That's useful information because it means we can ignore certain
          paths when we want to check for "Collatziness", although only if we're thinking about it from the
          generative perspective, because under "normal" circumstances we're always reducing <b>2k</b> to <b>k</b>.</p>

        <p>We also we get some unique numbers that don't matter for the Collatz conjecture, but combined with ℕ
          means we're spanning ℕ/3 (which has, perhaps amusing if you're not too familiar with infinities, the
          same number of elements in it as ℕ).</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Finding a more proof-friendly phrasing of the conjecture</h2>

		    <p>Conjectures of the type "this eventually works" is hard, so maybe we can rephrase the conjecture to
          something that easier to work with, or solves the problem by mathematical analogy, giving a different
          problem to solve that equates to solving the original problem. Looking at the Collatz sequences, a
          shortcut observation is that if we can get from any number <b>n</b> to the number 1, then we can rephrase
          that to the claim that for any <b>n</b> there is a finite-length path to some number <b>m</b> that's
          lower than <b>n</b>. In the worst case, <b>m</b> is 1, because that's the last step, but hopefully it's
          some number closer to <b>n</b> and we can get to it nice and quickly.</p>

          <p>Using that idea, let's rephrase the conjecture:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>for any <b>n</b>, <b>n</b> &gt; 1, there is a finite path to some <b>m</b>, 1 &le; <b>m</b> &lt; <b>n</b>.
        </ul>

        <p>The Collatz conjecture is then fulfilled if this rule holds recursively: if we can find some <b>m</b> that's
          smaller than <b>n</b> but higher than 1, and this rule holds, then we can find another <b>m'</b> that's
          smaller than <b>m</b>, and keep doing so until we reach 1.</p>

        <p>So let's run a quick list of numbers to see whether this rephrasing has simplified the problem we're
          trying to solve. First off, we can immediately see that for even numbers this rule is trivially upheld:
          the nature of division by "more than 1" means that the result of a division is strictly lower that the
          starting value. As such, all even numbers already follow this part of the conjecture. Solution space
          halved simply by picking better phrasing, awesome!</p>

        <p>For odd numbers the challenge is to now prove that there are finite length paths from any odd number <b>n</b>
          to lower numbers <b>m</b>. So, again, let's do a quick investigation using the power of a quick program to
          generate us some numbers:</p>

</pre>

        <p>Interesting...</p>

        <p>Generating these sequences is revealing patterns in the path lengths that fulfill the rephrased
          Collatz property. For instance, even if all the full path lenghts to reach 1 differ, we can see that
          every number <b>5 mod 4</b> has a path of length 3 from <b>n</b> to some <b>m &lt; n</b>. If we can
          say <em>why</em> then we have an excellent basis for reducing the solution space further and further,
          ideally to the point where it's empty.<p>

        <p>We see a few more possibly repeating steps, so let's script a little more and get some more data
          on which numbers (modulo which other numbers) have a known path length:</p>

<pre>
path length 3 : {5} mod 4
path length 6 : {3} mod 16
path length 8 : {11, 23} mod 32
path length 11: {7,15,59} mod 192
path length 13: {39,79,95,123,175,199,219,288} mod 256
path length 16: {287,347,367,423,507,575,583,735,815,923,975,999} mod 1024
path length 19: {...31 bases...} mod 4096
path length 21: {...85 bases...} mod 8192
path length 24: {...173 bases...} mod 32768
</pre>

        <p>Do these modulations make sense? They look like powers of two, but that 192 shows that they're
          not, so let's not get side tracked there. What about the base numbers? The first few look like
          they might all be primes, but the 15 and 39 show that's not true either.</p>

        <p>Another problem is that even if we can find the rules that govern which bases and modulo exist
          for which path length, we haven't solved the original problem: all we'll have shown is that for
          certain path lengths, there are Collatz numbers. Unless we can also prove that as we go up in
          path length, we generate ℕ, this avenue is interesting, but in terms of proving the Collatz
          conjecture, fruitless.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Collatz Conjecture status: still deep magic.</h2>
      </section>


<!--
      <section>
        <h2>Deriving the modulations</h2>

        <p>Let's look at this from another angle. Let's have a look at why we get those path lengths, by figuring out which path lengths necessitate which inputs.<p>

<h3>path length 1</h3>

        <p>Let's think about this mathematically: there must be a some number <b>n</b>, even or odd, which --when Collatz procedure'd-- generates an integer number <b>m</b> &lt <b>n</b>. Let's look at both cases, first even cases:</p>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &⇒ \frac{n}{2} &lt; n, n \equiv 2 \ mod\ 2
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>This is trivially true given the rules of arithmetic. Moving on to odd inputs:</p>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &⇒ 3 n + 1 &lt; n, n \equiv 1 \ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 3 n &lt; n-1, n \equiv 1 \ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ n &lt; \frac{n-1}{3}, n \equiv 1 \ mod\ 2
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>There is no integer <b>n</b> that will satisfy these relationships, and so there are no paths of length 1 for any odd number.<p>

<h3>path length 2</h3>

        <p>numbers that lead to a lower integer in 2 steps only need to come from odd <b>n</b>, because even numbers have path length 1,
          and we know the after the first step, the odd <b>n</b> will be an even number (by definition due to the Collatz procedure), and
          thus step 2 must necessarily be a division by 2:<p>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 ⇒ \frac{3 n + 1}{2} &lt; n, 3 n + 1 \equiv 1 \ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 3 n + 1 &lt; 2n, 3 n \equiv 0 \ mod\ 2 \equiv 2 \ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 3 n &lt; 2n - 1, n \equiv \frac{2}{3} \ mod\ \frac{2}{3} \\
            &⇒ 3 n &lt; 2n - 1, n \equiv 2 \ mod\ 2\ (due\ to\ needing\ to\ be\ integer)
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>Even if the equivalence can be met (which would mean there aren't actually any odd numbers for which there is path length 2, as
          <b>n</b> must be <b>2 mod 2</b>, which means it's even) that inequality requirement is impossible to fulfil. There are no numbers
          for which we can find a lower integer in 2 steps.</p>

<h3>path length 3</h3>

        <p>This is an odd path length, and we start with an odd number <b>n</b> (because even numbers are sorted already), and we <em>must</em>
          make this even as first step (due to the Collatz procedure), and then there are two possibilities: dividing this number by 2 will
          either yield an odd, or even number, either of which must be smaller than our starting <b>n</b>. So:</p>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} ⇒
               \frac{3 n + 1}{4} &lt; n, \frac{3 n + 1}{2} \equiv 2 \ mod\ 2
               \cap
               3 \frac{3 n + 1}{2} +1 &lt; n, \frac{3 n + 1}{2} \equiv 1 \ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 3 n + 1 &lt; 4 n, 3 n + 1 \equiv 4 \ mod\ 4
                \cap
                \frac{3 n + 1}{2} &lt; \frac{n - 1}{3}, \frac{3 n + 1}{2} \equiv 1 \ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 3 n &lt; 4 n - 1, 3 n \equiv 3 \ mod\ 4
                \cap
                \frac{3 n + 1}{2} &lt; \frac{n - 1}{3}, \frac{3 n + 1}{2} \equiv 1 \ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 3 n &lt; 4 n - 1, n \equiv 1 \ mod\ \frac{4}{3}

            &⇒ 3 n &lt; 4 n - 1, n \equiv 5 \ mod\ 4\ (because\ n\ must\ be\ integer\ and\ over\ 1)
                \cap
                3 n &lt; 2 \frac{n - 1}{3} + \frac{3}{3}, 3 n \equiv 1 \ mod\ 4 \\
            &⇒ n \equiv 5 \ mod\ 4
                \cap
                n &lt; 2n + 1, n \equiv \frac{1}{3} \ mod\ \frac{4}{3} \\
            &⇒ n \equiv 5 \ mod\ 4
                \cap
                n &lt; 2n + 1, n \equiv 1 \ mod\ 4\ (to\ be\ integer)
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>We find <b>n ≡ 5 mod 4</b> and <b>n ≡ 1 mod 4</b>, but we already know that <b>n=1</b> is ruled out
          by the basic rules of the Collatz procedure, so we simply see <b>n ≡ 5 mod 4</b> as the only solution
          for this path length.</p>

        <p>According to this, 5, 9, 13, 17, etc. should all lead to a lower number in 3 steps, and they do.</p>

<h3>path length 4</h3>

        <p>Again we must start with an odd <b>n</b>, which generates three possible scenarios tracks:
          1) odd -> even -> even -> even, 2) odd -> even -> even -> odd, 3) odd -> even -> odd -> even.
          The reason it's only three is that an odd number can only ever become even, so we can never
          have an [odd -> odd] subpattern.</p>

        <h4>odd -> even -> even -> even</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{3 n + 1}{4} ⇒ \frac{3 n + 1}{8} &lt; n,  \frac{3 n + 1}{4} \equiv 2\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 3 n + 1 &lt; 8 n, 3 n + 1 \equiv 8\ mod\ 8 \\
            &⇒ 3 n &lt; 8 n - 1, 3 n \equiv 7\ mod\ 8 \\
            &⇒ 3 n &lt; 8 n - 1, n \equiv \frac{7}{3}\ mod\ \frac{8}{3} \equiv 5\ mod\ 8 \\
            &⇒ -5 n &lt; - 1, n \equiv 5\ mod\ 8 \\
            &⇒ 5 n &gt; 1, n \equiv 5\ mod\ 8 \\
            &⇒ n &gt; \frac{1}{5}, n \equiv 5\ mod\ 8
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>For any <b>n</b> greater than 1 the inequality holds, and for these <b>n</b>, solutions are of the form <b>5 mod 8</b>,
          which is "meaningless" in that it overlaps with path length 3. However, it does tell us that 5, 13, 21, etc should <em>also</em>
          have a value <b>m &lt; n</b> after 4 steps:</p>

        <pre> 5: 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
 9: 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, 34, 17, ...
13: 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
17: 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, ...
21: 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1
25: 76, 38, 19, 58, 29, 88, 44, ...
29: 88, 44, 22, 11, 34, 17, 52, ...
33: 100, 50, 25, 76, 38, 19, 58, ...
37: 112, 56, 28, 14, 7, 22, 11, ...
41: 124, 62, 31, 94, 47, 142, 71, ...
45: 136, 68, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, ...</pre>

        <p>Indeed, <b>5 mod 8</b> not only shows <b>m &lt; n</b> in three steps, but also four steps, whereas <b>9 mod 8</b> shows
          all paths of length 4 to have an <b>m &gt; n</b>. So that's one of three cases examined. On to the next:</p>

        <h4>odd -> even -> even -> odd</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{3 n + 1}{4} ⇒ 3 \frac{3 n + 1}{4} + 1 &lt; n,  \frac{3 n + 1}{4} \equiv 2\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ \frac{9n + 7}{4} &lt; n, (already\ solved\ equivalence) \\
            &⇒ 9n + 7 &lt; 4 n \\
            &⇒ 5n &lt; -7 \\
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>This has no solutions in the positive integer domain: <b>n</b> would have to be negative for this inequality to hold.</p>

        <h4>odd -> even -> odd -> even</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → 3 \frac{3 n + 1}{2} + 1 → ⇒ \frac{9 n + 5}{4} + 1 &lt; n,  \frac{9 n + 5}{2} \equiv 1\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ \frac{9n + 5}{4} &lt; n, 9n + 5 \equiv 2\ mod\ 4 \\
            &⇒ 9n + 5 &lt; 4 n, 9n \equiv 1\ mod\ 4 \\
            &⇒ 5n &lt; -5, n \equiv \frac{1}{9}\ mod\ \frac{4}{9} \equiv 1\ mod\ 4
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>This has no solutions in the positive integer domain: <b>n</b> would have to be negative for this inequality to hold.</p>

<h3>path length 5</h3>

        <p>Sparing you this math, there are no new solutions for paths of length 5 (although there are some overlaps with previously found
          solutions in ways that mean solutions with path length 5 are already covered by path length 3 and 4).</p>

<h3>path length 6</h3>

        <p>This should yield a new result (namely, <b>3 mod 16</b>) so let's see if our approach holds up. First off, there are eight
          possible paths of length 6. That's starting to get a bit rich. Still, let's look at each of them:</p>

    <h4>odd -> even -> even -> even -> even -> even</h4>

        <p>We start with an odd number, which becomes even, and then stays even for the remainder of the path. If we take this series,
        what must <b>n</b> be?</p>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{3 n + 1}{4} → \frac{3 n + 1}{8} → \frac{3 n + 1}{16} ⇒ \frac{3 n + 1}{32} \\
            &⇒  \frac{3 n + 1}{32} &lt; n, \frac{3 n + 1}{16} \equiv 2\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒  3 n + 1 &lt; 32 n, 3 n + 1 \equiv 32\ mod\ 32 \\
            &⇒  29 n &gt; 1, 3 n \equiv 31\ mod\ 32 \\
            &⇒  29 n &gt; 1, n \equiv \frac{31}{3}\ mod\ \frac{32}{3} \\
            &⇒  n &gt; \frac{1}{29}, n \equiv 21\ mod\ 32
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>This solution is already contained by <b>5 mod 4</b>.</p>

    <h4>odd -> even -> even -> even -> odd -> even</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{3 n + 1}{4} → \frac{3 n + 1}{8} → \frac{9 n + 11}{8} ⇒ \frac{9 n + 11}{16} \\
            &⇒ \frac{9 n + 11}{16} &lt; n, \frac{9 n + 11}{8} \equiv 2\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 9 n + 11 &lt; 16n, 9 n + 11 \equiv 16\ mod\ 16 \\
            &⇒ 7 n &gt; 11, 9 n \equiv 5\ mod\ 16 \\
            &⇒ n &gt; \frac{11}{7}, n \equiv \frac{5}{9}\ mod\ \frac{16}{9} \equiv 13\ mod\ 16
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>This solution is also contained by <b>5 mod 4</b>.</p>

    <h4>odd -> even -> even -> even -> even -> odd</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{3 n + 1}{4} → \frac{3 n + 1}{8} → \frac{3 n + 1}{16} ⇒ \frac{9 n + 19}{16} \\
            &⇒ \frac{9 n + 19}{16} &lt; n, \frac{3 n + 1}{16} \equiv 1\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 9 n + 19 &lt; 16n, 3 n + 1 \equiv 16\ mod\ 32 \\
            &⇒ 7 n &gt; 19, 3 n \equiv 15\ mod\ 32 \\
            &⇒ n &gt; \frac{19}{7}, n \equiv 5\ mod\ \frac{32}{3} \equiv 5\ mod\ 32
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>This solution is also contained by <b>5 mod 4</b>.</p>

    <h4>odd -> even -> even -> odd -> even -> odd</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{3 n + 1}{4} → \frac{9 n + 7}{4} → \frac{9 n + 7}{8} ⇒ \frac{27 n + 29}{8} \\
            &⇒ \frac{27 n + 29}{8} &lt; n, \frac{9 n + 7}{8} \equiv 1\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 27 n + 29 &lt; 8 n, 9 n + 7 \equiv 8\ mod\ 16 \\
            &⇒ 19 n &lt; -29, 9 n \equiv 1\ mod\ 16 \\
            &⇒ n &lt; \frac{-29}{19}, n \equiv \frac{1}{9}\ mod\ \frac{16}{9} \equiv 9\ mod\ 16
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>There are no solutions for this path, since we'd need a negative <b>n</b>.</p>

    <h4>odd -> even -> odd -> even -> even -> even</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{9 n + 5}{2} → \frac{9 n + 5}{4} → \frac{9 n + 5}{8} ⇒ \frac{9 n + 5}{16} \\
            &⇒ \frac{9 n + 5}{16} &lt; n, \frac{9 n + 5}{8} \equiv 2\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 9 n + 5 &lt; 16 n, 9 n + 5 \equiv 16\ mod\ 16 \\
            &⇒ 7 n &gt; 5, 9 n \equiv 11\ mod\ 16 \\
            &⇒ n &gt; \frac{5}{7}, n \equiv \frac{11}{9}\ mod\ \frac{16}{9} \equiv 3\ mod\ 16
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>And there is our <b>3 mod 16</b> solution.</p>

    <h4>odd -> even -> odd -> even -> even -> odd</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{9 n + 5}{2} → \frac{9 n + 5}{4} → \frac{9 n + 5}{8} ⇒ \frac{27 n + 23}{8} \\
            &⇒ \frac{27 n + 23}{8} &lt; n, \frac{9 n + 5}{8} \equiv 2\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 27 n + 23 &lt; 16 n, (n \equiv same\ as\ above) \\
            &⇒ 11 n &lt; -23 \\
            &⇒ n &lt; \frac{-23}{11}
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>There are no solutions for this path, since we'd need a negative <b>n</b>.</p>

    <h4>odd -> even -> odd -> even -> odd -> even</h4>

        <p>\[\begin{align}
          n &→ 3 n + 1 → \frac{3 n + 1}{2} → \frac{9 n + 5}{2} → \frac{9 n + 5}{4} → \frac{27 n + 19}{4} ⇒ \frac{27 n + 19}{8} \\
            &⇒ \frac{27 n + 19}{8} &lt; n, \frac{27 n + 19}{4} \equiv 2\ mod\ 2 \\
            &⇒ 27 n + 19 &lt; 8 n, 27 n + 19 \equiv 8\ mod\ 8 \\
            &⇒ 19 n &lt; -19, 27 n + 19 \equiv -11\ mod\ 8 \equiv 5\ mod\ 8 \\
            &⇒ n &lt; -1, n \equiv \frac{5}{27}\ mod\ \frac{8}{27} \equiv 7\ mod\ 8\\
        \end{align}\]</p>

        <p>There are no solutions for this path, since we'd need a negative <b>n</b>.</p>

    <h4>In conclusion</h4>

        <p>So there is one (new) numerical sequence that lives up to the Collatz conjecture in six steps.</p>
