      <section id="preface">
        <p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture">Collatz Conjecture</a> is the first challenge I was
        ever genuinely presented with. We're not talking the "I dare you to ..." or "If you don't ... you will ...", but the kind
        where someone explains a challenging problem and all you can do is sit there and go "... challenge accepted". I was a
        first year student (well, technically third, but I switched universities so first year at my new university) at the
        University of Amsterdam, embarking on a five year study of Artificial Intelligence, and the dean of faculty (yes, A.I.
        was, and hopefully still is, its own faculty. It's not just computer science with a few electives) did the standard
        welcome speech, but he did it well. He talked about complexities, the travelling salesman problem, A*, and many other
        things but what caught me was the Collatz Conjecture. It's a stupidly simple statement: pick any integer number; if it's even
        divide it by two, and if it's odd multiply it by three and add one. No matter which number you start with, as long as
        you followed those two rules you will always end up at 1. After dropping this seemingly insignificant bombshell he
        finished it up with "it's a good example of a simple problem that is almost intractibly difficult to actually prove",
        and then went on to discuss optimizing algorithms by analysing loop invariants. I should point out this was before
        the Netherlands got sucked into the European Bachelor/Masters nonsense and a five year study meant "welcome to you're
        serious about learning some shit, let's not joke around, you're paying for this".</p>

        <p>I like the Collatz conjecture. I like it a lot. Every few months I'll try to figure out something new about the
        sequence of numbers associated with it, and it's just one of those dumb recreational math things you can work on
        when you get bored with everything else. It's still there. Unsolved. So simple. Two rules. Unproven... and it doesn't
        even use any complicated mathematical notions. It's just the natural numbers, and the basic operations of arithmetic.
        What deep magic lies here....?</p>
      </section>

      <section id="introduction">
        <h2 data-num="1">Introduction</h2>

        <p>So, the Collatz Conjecture. Let's formalize it a little, because it's a really simple algorithm so let's write it
        out as one.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pick a number <b>n</b>. Literally any number <b>n</b> as long as it's an integer number (i.e. a whole number)
            and greater than 1.</li>
          <li>While <b>n</b> > 1:
            <ul>
			  <li>If <b>n</b> is even, set <b>n ← n / 2</b></li>
			  <li>If <b>n</b> is odd, set <b>n ← 3 * n + 1 </b></li>
			</ul>
	      </li>
	      <li>this loop always terminates, with <b>n</b> equal to 1</li>
        </ul>

        <p>That's it. The conjecture is "this algorithm is correct".</p>
      </section>

      <section id="resolution">
        <h2 data-num="1">So, let's resolve some chains to see where this takes us.</h2>

        <ul>
	      <li>1</li>
	      <li>2 → 1</li>
	      <li>3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
	      <li>4 → 2 → 1</li>
	      <li>5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
	      <li>6 → 3 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
	      <li>7 → 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
	      <li>8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
	      <li>9 → 28 → 14 → 7 → 22 → 11 → 34 → 17 → 52 → 26 → 13 → 40 → 20 → 10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
	      <li>10 → 5 → 16 → 8 → 4 → 2 → 1</li>
        </ul>

        <p> Not all that far, really. We need a better view on what this series is doing.</p>
      </section>

      <section id="generating">
        <h2 data-num="1">Generating Collatz sequences</h2>

        <p>What if we look at it from the other way? Instead of taking a number and reducing it to 1, let's
        take a number and see which Collatz sequence it can generate. If we do we can use the following algorithm:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Pick an integer number <b>n</b></li>
          <li>generate with it the number <b>n*2</b>. This is a Collantz sequence number.</li>
          <li>generate with it the number <b>(n-1)/3</b>. If integer, this is a Collantz sequence number.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>What does that give us?</p>

        <ul>
	      <li>1 → 2 and 0</li>
	      <li>2 → 4 and 1/3</li>
	      <li>3 → 6 and 2/3</li>
	      <li>4 → 8 and 1</li>
	      <li>5 → 10 and 4/3</li>
	      <li>6 → 12 and 5/3</li>
	      <li>7 → 14 and 2</li>
	      <li>8 → 16 and 7/3</li>
	      <li>9 → 18 and 8/3</li>
	      <li>10 → 20 and 3</li>
	      <li>11 → 22 and 10/3</li>
	      <li>12 → 24 and 11/3</li>
	      <li>13 → 26 and 4</li>
	      <li>14 → 28 and 13/3</li>
	      <li>15 → 30 and 14/3</li>
	      <li>16 → 32 and 5</li>
	      <li>17 → 34 and 16/3</li>
	      <li>18 → 36 and 17/3</li>
	      <li>19 → 38 and 6</li>
	      <li>20 → 40 and 19/3</li>
	      <li>...</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Interesting. We see that only 1 mod 3 generates an integer number (which makes sense), that 1 mod 6 generates
        an even integer, and that 4 mod 6 generates an odd integer. We also see that this expansion doesn't quite generate
        ℕ sparsely (meaning some integers are repeated), and we get some unique numbers that don't matter for the Collatz
        conjecture, but combined with ℕ means we're spanning ℕ/3 (which has, amusing, the same number of elements in it
        as ℕ).</p>

		<p>let's rephrase the conjecture to something simpler, bearing this list in mind...</p>

        <ul>
          <li>for any <b>n</b>, <b>n</b> &gt; 1, there is a finite path to some <b>m</b>, <b>n</b> &gt; <b>m</b> &ge; 1.
        </ul>

        <p>Applying this recursively (remember: for <em>any</em> <b>n</b>) means we'll always arrive at 1.</p>

        <p>for even numbers this rule is trivially upheld; the nature of division by "more than 1" means that the result
        of a division is strictly lower that the starting value. As such, all even numbers already follow this part of
        the conjecture.</p>

        <p>For odd numbers the challenge is to now proove that there are finite length paths from odd number <b>n</b> to
        <em>any</em> lower number <b>m</b>. Let's do a quick investigation</p>

<pre>  4 → 8 - 1
 10 → 20 - 3		m < n in 8 steps
 16 → 32 - 5		m < n in 5 steps
 22 → 44 - 7		m < n in 13 steps

 94 → 188 - 31		m < n in 93 steps
100 → 200 - 33		m < n in 5 steps
106 → 212 - 35		m < n in 8 steps
112 → 224 - 37		m < n in 5 steps
118 → 236 - 39		m < n in 15 steps
124 → 248 - 41		m < n in 5 steps

136 → 272 - 45		m < n in 5 steps
142 → 284 - 47		m < n in 90 steps
148 → 296 - 49		m < n in 5 steps
154 → 308 - 51		m < n in 8 steps
160 → 320 - 53		m < n in 5 steps
166 → 332 - 55		m < n in 10 steps
172 → 344 - 57		m < n in 5 steps
178 → 356 - 59		m < n in 13 steps
184 → 368 - 61		m < n in 5 steps
190 → 380 - 63		m < n in 90 steps
196 → 392 - 65		m < n in 5 steps
202 → 404 - 67		m < n in 8 steps
208 → 416 - 69		m < n in 5 steps
214 → 428 - 71		m < n in 85 steps
</pre>

        <p>Interesting. Every 16 mod 12th number has a path of length 5. If we remove those, we see another modulo:</p>

<pre>4 → 8 - 1		[*]
10 → 20 - 3		[*]	 v < b in 8 steps
22 → 44 - 7		[*]	 v < b in 13 steps
34 → 68 - 11		[*]	 v < b in 10 steps
46 → 92 - 15		[*]	 v < b in 13 steps
58 → 116 - 19		[*]	 v < b in 8 steps
70 → 140 - 23		[*]	 v < b in 10 steps
82 → 164 - 27		[*]	 v < b in 98 steps
94 → 188 - 31		[*]	 v < b in 93 steps
106 → 212 - 35		[*]	 v < b in 8 steps
118 → 236 - 39		[*]	 v < b in 15 steps

250 → 500 - 83		[*]	 v < b in 8 steps
262 → 524 - 87		[*]	 v < b in 10 steps

394 → 788 - 131		[*]	 v < b in 8 steps
406 → 812 - 135		[*]	 v < b in 13 steps
</pre>

        <p>paths of length 8 seem to occur at 10 mod 48... let's plot some more:</p>

<pre> 5: {16} mod 12
 8: {10} mod 48
10: {34, 70} mod 96
13: {22,46,178} mod 384
15: {118,238,286,371,526,598,658,866} mod 768
18: {862,1042,1102,1270,1522,1726,1750,2206,2446,2770,2926,2998} mod 3072
21: {...31 bases...} mod 12288
23: {...85 bases...} mod 24576
26: {...173 bases...} mod 98304
</pre>

        <p>Do these modulations make sense?</p>

<pre> 5: mod 12 x 1
 8: mod 12 x 4
10: mod 12 x 8
13: mod 12 x 32
15: mod 12 x 64
18: mod 12 x 256
21: mod 12 x 1024
23: mod 12 x 2048
26: mod 12 x 8192
</pre>

        <p>sort of? but where are 2, 16, 128, 512, 4096 etc? Where are these gaps coming from?</p>
